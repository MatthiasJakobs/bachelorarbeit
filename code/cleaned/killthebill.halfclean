the is safe for now a small but significant victory
you cant draft a bill behind closed doors and expect people to support it

when trump fails he finds someone to blame or something to deflect to
the affordable care act survives its first attack by republican misanthropes a win for americans human decency &amp compassion
house republicans before a vote just show the incompetence level after 7 years of yelling repeal
just want to make people laugh
trump called the to say they were pulling the bill so i guess the press is useful after all
i wouldnt need healthcare if rs channeled their obsession w/repealing obamacare into fixing it id drop dead
thank you to all of my fellow amercans who pressed lawmakers to back off our healthcare &amp to that would leave people to die
whats often irrefutably true is also often said plain and simple
phones were ringing off the hook voicemail was full of course they pulled the bill of course

trump fans should have to give up obamacare for trumpcare lets see how they like it after 4 years  if theyre still alive
how lucky are we to get to share a planet with john lewis
the bill to repeal did not make sense for people fiscally or physically
so proud we were able to
gop complained about obamacare for the last 7 years so in all that time they couldnt come up with something better
good riddance maybe just maybe next time around well see a bill that deals with costs not one that just cuts help 4 poor
sometimes all you catch is a nice view
while ryan and house republicans sweat vp has fun in capitol hill club
now that we were able to we must go back to focusing on trump and his russia ties
none of this is okay i need health coverage to cope with all of this

donald trump is a failure who cant deliver
of course trump was getting grumpy he needs to pack for his weekly trip to mar a lago
hey now lets not piss on the ashes of the bill yet thats trumps job in a russian hotel suite
now that the house republicans failed to kill 24 million americans what trick will they pull next

dear mr president house rep realized poor whites in their district would be affected too
trump/gop to blame obamacare/dems in 5432
trump logic if we pull the bill before the vote it cant be seen as a failure
showboating republicans voted 60 times to kill and replace obamacare but when the time came to act they failed
no dana republicans won those years because some white folks couldnt stand to a black first family
trump had his shot and he airballed
rs orchestrated 60+ obamacare repeal votes  couldnt pull off a single one when it counted
isnt this the equivalent of flipping over the table when you are losing at spades
donald trump and paul ryans health care plan was just withdrawn obama cant relate
they managed to but dont kid yourselves unless we vote them out theyll take another shot at it
will not come up for a vote in the house but sniffles guarantees that it will win in electoral college
lets replace congress with 1st graders they could and would get more done than these imbeciles for real

house republicans &amp trump just wasted time &amp $ for nothing on a bad bill epic fail ryan
the only fix to is not the corporate crap pushed by
*record scratch* *freeze frame* yup thats me youre probably wondering how i ended up in this situation …
hey dont worry having your own head removed from your own ass is covered by obamacare
so you think theyre tired of winning yet
you didnt want to be a loser so instead you are a quitter

the best part about rn is watching ppl argue the virtues of one shitty healthcare bill vs another shitty healthcare bill
the butterfly uh oh thats old lemme see that tootsie roll
profoundly gratifying afternoon at the office

difference now is that those were for show and didnt need specifics now they have to show their hand to voters
trumps first legislative effort fails as gop pulls bill to repeal obamacare via

it makes me feel better about them pulling the bill to know that feels like this is a defeat
toy story is up telling his lies in a press conference paul ryan just lies and lies
doing big things is hard dropping the truth bombs after his stunning failure
well it looks like trumpy trump the great businessman 😕 dealmaker couldnt make it happen  😁 obama did the work  7 years 0
sweep the old trash out
flaccid republicans show that having 7 years to come up with a fix of the aca they are incapable of keeping their promises

theres something wrong with him no question even if he had made the deal
you win short sweet and oh so perfect
trump claims the dems killed bill we need to keep killing bad bills until 2018 when we can really drain the swamp
they should probably bring that truck back for donald to go vroom vroom in
and down goes their tax bill
trump is always 10 steps ahead~

the breaking news that the gop is eating crow this fine friday is the highlight of my week
ryan sounds like hes about to turn attentions to killing off medicare and social security while still lying about obamacare
this is why we need to $1625 with insurance $103848 without id be dead or broke
almost made it that calls for a participation trophy (thought that one only used for snowflakes)
trump just nullified ryan who couldnt come up with a good bill to garner congressional support step aside let trump work it
sadly not surprised that it took risking healthcare for 24m americans to get some bipartisan response to the madness
still thinks this was a good bill

how sad is america were celebrating the defeat of a bill designed to do one thing hurt poor people
ryan is still spineless what a joke
at least they killed the bill instead of the millions of americans without healthcare coverage
be careful just because the they doesnt mean they cant make adjustments to ensure the doesnt succeed

this👏🏽 is 👏🏽what👏🏽 you 👏🏽get 👏🏽for 👏🏽messing👏🏽 with 👏🏽peoples👏🏽 healthcare👏🏽…
your ego are hurt remember you work for the pplnot for your own agenda
big smiles here this evening 😀
gop wasted so much energy focused on demonizing the name obama in the aca they failed to produce a winning product
paul ryan shamelessly says we came close you had 7 years this is an epic failure
trumps negotiations tactics fail to kill 24 million americans arent you glad hes su…
close but no cigar  you lost big time anyway you look at it 
how long are we going to have to listen to republicans whine about how hard governing is why are you there
is he wearing a green tie for luck well it didnt work 🤔😂🤣 speaker ryan
speaker ryan we came really close (on health care bill) america
saying it was close my bs detector keeps going off if they were close they would ram it through
too bad you shameless bloodsucker we won
if thinks the is going through growing pains now just wait until midterms
the party of no do not even have what it needs to be a party of it sucks to be wins
give me a break and the gop have had seven years to get a replacement plan ready
winning is easy governing is harder ryan finally got a chance to listen to hamilton
youre a fail president fail health care bill fail party fail promises
after 8 years of only blocking any kind of governing the gop find they dont have any talent of governing…
hey paul ryan do us a real favor douchebag and resign
4 all who said protesting wont help whats the pt or it takes too longtake notice today✊️👊people standing up ch…
this guy is the original destroyer of the american health care system let obamacare implode
speaker ryan and the gop so obsessed with the repealing of obamacare face it republicans you all fail to pass it😂😂👊✊
i want the same that congress gets
the american rallying cry for 2018 and 2020 is clear
this from the guy who saw 15mil at inauguration not too savvy at numbers so that means at least 40 votes
we were a 10year opposition partybeing against things was easy you just had to be against it  ryan
his whole career has been a setback for the american people
the freedom caucus won has its first legislative battle of the trump administration
i have watched this many times over because it is so uplifting to see a legislator do and say this
trump right again remember he wanted the obama care to implode on its own he new the rep wouldnt be able to pass a bill
the people spoke as i have said before we need to improve upon and expand the aca not start over with a disaster
trump/ryan care bill was a crappy bill that only a tiny % (17%) of the people agreed withits yours &amp your parties…
saying that gop can move on to tax reform like
well aint that a knee slapper
obamacare is the law of the land i have never appreciated the concept of schadenfreude like i do now
when will the first rage tweet from trump be issued
hahahaha get that healthcare bill outta here bitches
as a constituent of co district 1 i am asking you to please vote against defunding
this makes look incredible and awful
lol trump is one of the pettiest presidentshe made everyone go through debates just to pull out
ahhhh hahahaha ha ha dear republicans yall had seven years to figure out your replacement health care bill…
how can you come up short after preparing for 7yrs lmaocant make this junk up ryan
retweet this tweet👇 one zillion times
holds press conference and talks out of his ass
stood together to aca remains the law of the land today we breathe tomorrow we continue to fight
paul ryan sounds like he just admitted he doesnt know how to govern and the president isnt a leader
is heading to maralago this weekend he must be exhausted after all this winning
fuck im so sick of winning please no more winning
doing big things is hard
oh so true fucking that
is proof that black dont crack
cant wait for spicer press conference about how obamacare repeal was a huge success that brought together the gop
thank you for your incredible leadership and for never giving up
aca lives still god bless you president obama you cant try to kill people without the people rallying against you
its almost like americans dont want gop policies
paul ryan desperately insisting he hasnt last all hope of efficacy is my favorite paul ryan

trumpcares failure summed up simply by

hey paul ryan you keep using this word close not sure you know what you think it means
nothing paul ryan said he wanted to would improve anyones life
i expect idiots in red hats to thank the conman in chief for saving their healthcare from the evil democrats at any moment now
was waiting for someone to make this joke
1 right now republicans control all branches of government
paul ryan says we as a party have to move from obstructing to running the govt &amp complain about dem not helping them naturally
failure get used to it 🤣
what was rigged was the election with russian interference the public deserves an open…
next up on the agenda
screw you loser youre a pussy and in your face for wanting a win at the expense of americans 😡
i feel soooooo bad for republicans they didnt get to kill off health insurance for 24m people boo hoo
lives americans retain their healthcare noone loses coverage the world is good again…
yo boy trump killing it with them dealthe man the prodigy the failure what a low energy guy is 💀
lets all take a nice cleansing breath
just said it was easy to obstruct as an opposition party but its hard to govern as governing party 👈🏼
you may won the battle but you lost the war
ugh dont gloat be better and do better cant poke them in the eye if you want cooperation to actually fix
guessing lots of death metal on tonight
republicans got complete control of the executive and legislative branches and they still cant repeal aca 😂…
bwahahaha good thing the republicans still have coverage to treat that sick burn that jill just gave them p
paul ryan is now apologizing for not being able to destroy the lives of millions of americans freakin psycho
we can all feel good for awhile longer now
we were a ten year opposition party where being against things was easy to do holy shit ryan actually said that
phony republicans were responsible for failure of known as disastrous obamacare what a freaking disappointment thanks ryan
ooh how i wish this was true
why dont you do the logical thing and just fix the parts of aca that arent working well work with dems
bwahaha opposition is easy governing is hard congratulations shit head your learning
hey you tired of winning yet
the another colossal failure for 7 years and you feel shortagain
2 blocked immigration eos aca replacement doa taxpayers paying for the wall troop buildup in syria gee so much winning 😒😒
art of the deal republicans and trump on campaign trail we will repeal and replace obamacare after elected just kidding
to those who wanted to vote yes on the proposed healthcare bill 2018
you had 7 years and you royally fucked it up you cretin 😁😁😁
ding dong the bill is dead now speaker ryan try paying attention to what we want instead of your pocketbook
i cant handle this thread
well now we know the republicans do believe in some form of birth control the pull out method
hey trump sometimes the art of the deal isnt just about your magical pen these are peoples lives…
i guarantee you that the vast majority of americans  the 99%  are relieved and elated right now
hes still trying 2 sell the plan poor baby the loss hasnt set in yet
it was another $ grab for the rich  this is what happens late at night behind closed doors
gop (2016) yeah were gonna kill obamacare gop (2017) you know maybe idk
80% oppose trumps budget cuts as approval honesty ratings sink to new low speaker ryan…
average tax cut under gop health care plan
is still in place just make it better governors that are blocking medicaid expansion are the problem sad is done
watching speak is literally painful  visually and auditorily
what do you call a man who cant admit defeat or apologize refuses to be accountable &amp first to blame…
congratulations morons you saved obamacare and blew tax reform in one shot
i dont even want a replacement government needs to stay out of healthcare
live view of right now
if the aca is a disaster 7 you still cant pass your acha bill that means your bill is worse than a disaster…
there is something about that needs to be stated dems passed disaster because ideology rs refused to do same
republicans are pissed deal with it
yeah b/c theyre frauds they ran on it b/c they wanted votes not to help the american people
schadenfreude is shamefully satisfying (who needs a razor)
paul ryans hopes and dreams shattered ayn rand looking up from hell disappointedly
in this case it is not a bad result terrible terrible bill
thank you saturn especially saturn in sagittarius for opposing trumps sun in gemini and connecting to his moon in sagittarius
blame yourselves for trying to take health care access away from 24 million americans
you dont have the votes  you do t have the votes
much better than the 2step
this bill went down bigly
paul ryan in live interview says they are moving on to tax reform can anyone else confirm
been saving this for just the right time lol plz choke on that enormous bag o dicks you just got served
thats right is the law of the land yes 👏🏽
president bannon must be pissed millions wont die
hey would you mind holding this l
donnie &amp ryan made a deal not to blame each other obamacare is still the law of the land 👍👏👏
ryan and the gop are now blaming the democrats for their trumpcare failure the rich will have to wait for the tax rebate
 i talked w/ the president just a little while ago &amp i told him i believe the best thing to do is pu…
much be so sick of winning at this point 🙄
paul ryan obamacare is still the law of the land for the foreseeable future
today im still glad i wrote in ted cruz for president
moc should investigate billing procedures &amp why there is so much disparity between health care facilities
if paul ryans lips are moving hes lying
hope youre havin a good day i hope there were no disappointments for you
this bill is much like you and your favorite word the bill and you are an 🇺🇸disaster👎🏾👎🏾👎🏾👎🏾👎🏾👎🏾👎🏾👎🏾👎🏾👎🏾👎🏾
this press conference is incredible 7 years countless show repeals bluster antagonism and the emperor has no clothes
and heres the moment we all knew was coming 😂😂😂
i wish we had a legitimate president
sorry but i think its only a 37% approval rating lol
let obamacare fail give the dems what they want and we will see what happens we wouldnt be in this mess if it wasnt for them
time to tuck your tails and slink off to another vacation huh
what a good day for the american people congrats from germany lets hope many good days lie ahead
i wish that speaker ryan would stop saying he wants 216 people to write a bill he should want 435 to agree and write a bill
pathetic ryan blaming democrats for lose blame the republican party your orange bitch and your eddie munster loo…
has happened way to go for your no votes and everyone who voted no
😂😂😂 ryan says the gop were doing the architects of obamacare a favor seriously
so now just let die on its own there will be no replacement
republicans are desperately trying to figure out a way that their inability to figure this out is somehow obamas f…
nobody knew health care could be so complicated 😂
obama care still law of the land paul ryan
trump comes up short again

you had 7 years and you royally fucked it up you cretin 😁😁😁
republicans forced to abort health care bill incompatible with life
it wasnt a little short it was an epic fail 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
people do not let trump lie to you do not have enough people to it was the gop who…
the had one good shot at repeal &amp replace and blew it &amp shouldnt trust them again they cant rule
go home paul ryan and think about what you did
at least paul ryan can do one thing well he gave cause for trump supporters bernie bros and shillbots to find common ground
worked dont do what u or lobbyists want vote what your constituents want
paul ryans bill failed cause not every gop was willin to sit back &ampwatch americans die to save the 1% some
beautiful words beautiful day god bless us everyone
i picked up on that hes right
house ✓ senate ✓ white house✓ 7 years to create a better health care plan ✓ enough votes to repeal and replace x
pulls out thankfully we still have
is toast now back to &lt3 drac 🗽
fade in camera pans to obama humming you cant always get what you want he raises a glass of bubbly fade out
muslim ban gone obama care repeal gone whats next when do we get to say trump administration gone
healthcare bill dead went down like ramsey bolton  ripped apart by his own dogs and it feels so good to be sansa…
yeah bc you definitely wouldnt want her to get pregnant on that health care bill anyway
doing democrats a favor ok ryan 😂
wow another failure you should give up and let a real leader take over
gop presenting the bill for a house vote like
its okay buddy just give it another 7 years and maybe youll think of something thatll actually get voted on
love these softballs from the msm to this evil bastard ryan first q from are you fuck…
heartbreaking vote scheduled for 330
way to go usa  🤗❤️🌎❤️🤗
gop pls fix the problems you created dont propose underfunded high risk pools as a solution
this right here this is mega level stupid turned up to 11
to the inclusive process was talking about
when fails an angel gets their wings
the implosion of the gop begins looking forward to 2018
youd think after 7yrs of bitching theyd actually have something in mind
joining proud resisters at the rally at the capitol live now
anyone with a little legislative knowledge knows its extremely hard to pass laws and even harder to repeal them…
id like to make the radical suggestion that &amp work together to make obamacare better
i love when white people talk about how much worse it is being a majority
if there was a drinking game wed get drunk on how many times paul ryan said we were close
what really means is they were going to get their asses kicked so they pulled it to save face
goodnews today today we won the aca lives
pulling out is my new favorite form of contraception
you had 7 years and you royally fucked it up you cretin 😁😁😁
they pulled out before it was donefunny cause thats the only birth control that wouldve been available on that plan too
i think ted is enjoying this a little too much
proof that no one is supporting you now fbi and prison is not far off
ryan was offering death care and giving benefit to insurance co and the rich has had 7 yrs offered us people nothing
failure speech not oscarworthy the speaker got his pussy grabbed rnc/dnc agree on 1 thing (he sucks)
will be trending every day in paul ryans head for the rest of his pathetic sniveling life
we will continue to prevail and keep you from fulfilling your dream of killing those less fortunate th…
i hope this is the final nail in paul ryans coffin
this is what we can do if we make our voices heard now we take one breath &amp get ready for the next fight
yeah bitches (obama from his surveillance van outside the white house)
speaker ryan breaking  trump pulls healthcare bill makes way for better one
dear 2 things 1 gop doesnt know how to lead just obstruct bush shouldve taught you that &amp 2 hahahahahahahaha
2 months into trumps presidency then best thing hes done is do nothing and step aside for obamas work lol
when social security was going bust in the 80s dems didnt own that did a bipartisan fix w/ gop why not same w/…
gop doesnt know how to govern they only know how to obstruct todays shitshow is evidence to that
anyone want 2mention the fact that tax payers pay4 politicians 2have free healthcare &amp they wanted2 get rid of ours…
yes is off the table no is a win for americans
we couldnt get a consensus today maybe bc you tried to pass it in less than 3 wks w/ no amendments or hearings
the bill wouldve allowed insurance companies to opt out of paying for prescription drugs &amp maternity care
gloating aside and yes there will be lots i am happy that people who need healthcare the most will be able to keep it
no trumocareno travel banbritain+australia upsettaxes pay 4 wall not mexicoflynn firedrussia investigation losers
thank goodness i was going to be one of the 24 million uninsured
lol oh please oh please
another blow for trump breaking speaker ryan &amp house republicans short of votes withdraw health care bill…
and this is why they couldnt let it go to a vote they knew it was a killer bill (in the literal sense)
if by setback means hes getting voted out in 2018 then i agree
the spin is making me dizzy anyone have dramamine is it covered under
we just saw a very very defeated man in paul ryan lol
its true that trump tried to get rid of the individual mandate but he wanted to keep preexisting conditions which is wrong
my thumbs are going to break from hitting retweet
great work on now on to full speed ahead
hey donny healthcare is actually bigger than a hotel youre not qualified
youre delusional there is nothing good in your bill &amp thats why it failed &amp will remain oppo…
being weirdly honest just said it was easy to be an opposition party against everything &amp now its hard govern
hey read a book you might be less confused
heynext time you ask a few women to help you im sure theyll be able to do better than you and they wont kill
another fascinating day in us 
i feel like paul ryan just figured out he needed 216 votes to pass something in the house never had that problem before 😂😂😂
art of the deal 😎relax speaker ryan🦏&amp better than a good day&amp there were none w/obamacare🔥 fixit🥊
you had 7 years and you royally fucked it up you cretin 😁😁😁
once again were saved by the fact that and are both terrible at their jobs…
we are going to be living with obamacare for the foreseeable future
gop 11am = falcons fans in 1st quarter of sb 51 gop 330am = falcons fans in the 4th quarter of sb 51
cant wait for tomorrow night
i wonder if hes tired yet of all this winning
now maybe we can focus on other r words like revise and refine and repair
paul ryan took the l for his boss
how can a risk pool ever be more affordable common sense dictates that those who need more care need more coverage
sounds like the asked themselves what kind of health care do we want in
we dont like kings very much in america its kinda not our thing
we have to replace trump &amp his delusional cabinet 🙈🙉🙊 not our health and welfare
thank you to everybody that helped
hey please make sure to keep your promise that the aca stays we know you like to say one thing and do another
doing things is hard everyone else no shit sherlock
i have multiple family members who depend on medicaid to survive fuck the ahca which will slash 300 billion from medicaid
is this all the winning trump was talking about or did he mistake the word winning for whining
no need to that shit committed seppuku
please is nothing but 20
now to get them to not have the inhumane bear &amp wolf killing in alaska

thank who are the smart enough to youre welcome
thank you folks for to trump failed to repeal
heres why no vote is a shame reps who would have voted yes get to enter 2018 without that disfigurement on their record
remember when was told to pull his healthcare reform bill
paul ryan said they were close to depriving 24 million people of health care but didnt quite make it
all of trumps golfing and pretend semitruck driving couldnt save the bill
i knew you fucktards couldnt get a single fucking thing done amazing 🤗
ryan talks about this loss being just a result of growing pains  that is total bullshit
today is as good a day as ever for this tweet the have learned nothing
see moderate tories even when official opposition is absent u can defeat your own partys extremism you can beat hard brexit
doing big things is hard paul ryan barack obama did big things in spite of you mr ryan
lets tell the truth the is responsible for all the problems has they have been trying to kill it from day 1
ryan says designed in flawed manner in 1yr it had 70 hearings 181 witnesses &amp 121 amendments
was saved todaythank god we were able to
the same street and hospital300% price difference for the same service
ok ok worked now back 2 immediately
trump and ryan are mad they didnt get any dem support how about you write a bill that expands coverage and then well talk
what was that gop its hard to legislate
sounds good to me  and millions of americans
epic fail by the gop and i am loving it
that time shit the bed on a promise 7 years in the making
youre a liar you dont have votes due to angry voters demanding you save aca

mt stands firm thank you members
every time fails an angel gets its wings
you were right i actually am getting tired of winning thank you
apparently sucks at closing deals
paul ryan basically said my job is hard my bad
conservatives right now its not a repeal so fuggetaboutit

the can rally around a known criminal but the kill themselves
legitimately curious how fox news and breitbart will spin this to be anything less than an unmitigated disaster
art of the deal paul ryan and trump on campaign trail we will repeal and replace obamacare after elected just kidding 🤣
was so bad that republicans couldnt pass it despite controlling congress &amp the white house
thank you next time to bring the insurance companies to the table
a day like today is what makes worthwhile everyones crying happy tears and sad
ha in my incase you missed it section of twitter
well with that nonsense out of the way time to and
guess wanted to run off like most of his party does when presented with real questions
same concept as should focus on lowering medical costs &amp not bankrupting…
i normally dont tweet about political stuff for my own sanity but in this case
the levels here actual jordan was probably on the republican side of this issue
might want to unpin this tweet now )
a big thank you to those of you brace enough to say no to trumpcare out of conscience and integrity
paul ryan looking like he wanted to cry leaving that briefing and i dont feel bad at all
when i saw that art of the deal was trending i knew it was going to be delicious
i wish we could tar and feather paul ryan like the cuck he is
resign or get voted out
yaaaaaassssssss thinking of all my families today ❤

how many people hit a home run on their first swing get back in the box &amp hit the next one out of the park
wheres the closer big time negotiator big deal maker 😆
🗣 and a big group hug
that was a religious experience for liberals
trump didnt pull the bill bc hes a good person they didnt have the votes to pass and he didnt want to look weak
me too god me too

lots to keep fighting for but will indulge in some celebrating tonight
looking forward to maternity care for all the babies born nine months from now 🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸
it was the right decision why put the boat in the water when your gut says it will sink

i hope yall know the democrats just got some good campaign material for 2018
paul ryan was it worth it
hows that going for you donald
obama biden and all us sick americans who arent gonna die now like
yes republican party had it easy when all they had to do was disagree with obama much harder to agree
buhbye the resistance is just getting started
is dead according to paul ryan we the people have spoken when we act we
a huge thank you to the dems continuing to work hard also ty gops who listened to us and voted their conscience
&amp the gop are a shit show they dont have the american peoples interest in mind…
doing big things is hard it sure is  it sure is
better make sure you have 1001 followers by 1159 im for sure defriending at midnight
nope its time to fix the aca thats the more logical and mature approach
nice try now its time to be rick rolled
me when i heard they had to
what a buzzkill youre right of coursebut still this is exhausting and its only been whattwo months
key word of this sentence living douchebag
ryan out trying to spin this illustrates that gop trying to force this was mistake now bilateral effort to fix is needed
so you always win well not today on the it was
time to tuck your tails and slink off to another vacation huh
ryan is going to cheer himself up by throwing a suitcase filled with puppies into the potomac
how are kicking off the weekend
i cannot believe how easily and folded on health care
watch they will try to make the aca fail so they can get what they want
yes take moment savor our success you may also take a few dozen more to enjoy ryans/trump failure
watching paul ryans speak about pulling the healthcare bill we were so close not close enough obviously…
what do you always say winning more like whining
every single one of our senators and representatives should fight this hard for their constituents
the closest ive seen anybody come to saying an expletive without actually saying it john lewis is a rock star…
the only competent left are criminals
disappointed in the small number of you dont have the votes gifs/quotes im seeing today
maga sure quiet intel on art of the deal &amp team speaker ryan
and millions of regular americans will also be able to live for the foreseeable future thanks to obamacare…
wow that opens my naive little eyes 
so given 7 years the house senate and white house you still dont have a better idea than
so during 7 years of promising to repeal republicans never considered what theyd do dog chasing cars finally caught one
today learned that its lot harder to whip the votes against when lives are actually on the line
doing big things is hard 🤣🤣😂😂😂 because we all know its coming
trumpcare crashes &amp burns in the fiery horrible death it deserves
like when andrew johnson upheld segregation
look out toddler trump is going to be throwing some epic tantrums soon
i thought of kill bill which is a great movie btw
did seriously just complain about the difficulties of having a house majority
trump is now waiting for democrats to come riding to the rescue wow this is what the rw voted for wow speaker ryan
president trump knows exactly who and what is
dont they realize obamacare is failing anyway how dumb are they really
with only 17% approval most of america said hell no to this shitty bill wasnt just dems that didnt want it
help fund care in north texas
healthcare bill pulled never went 2 vote unsuccessful consensus 5 or 6 votes short go back 2 drawing board…
had to play this silly game first stand back &amp watch as our brilliant works
couldnt have said it better
what does it say that pulling the health care bill and keeping obamacare is the best achievement of to date
sending a shout out to all those who did not allow themselves to be bullied we all live thanks
if you played the drinking game every time he said you are currently like this here
ryans curious response to fallout obsession with word replacement but lack of mention of full repeal
just presented in nv hhs committee glad they pulled the bill but well move 4ward just in case they try stunt again
looks like the house may need to borrow hillarys reset button
and then he said hell immediately repeal and replace obamacare
so let me get this straight trump has failed yet again not at all surprised
speaker ryan art of the deal
just admitted that house republicans are learning how to govern
if you hate your obamacare you get to keep it thanks and house republicans
its going down exactly how trump planned have faith trump knows what hes doing
watching trying to pass his health insurance bill
paul ryans auro on fleek
loser sad now focus on and
exactly  look at plan
wants a win for himself not america 😡
was a bad bill period no system is perfect but the best solution is clear
why are you &amp others happy about this so many people cant afford health ins companies dropping

only the republicans with a majority in the house senate and wh can f&amp$k this up
after 8 years of repeal and replace this is how it all ends stumped by reality and an awful heartless bill
my favorite part of this afternoon is listening to all the excuses
before you take your victory lap remember obamacare is not sustainable &amp americans will be in big trouble very soon
speaker ryan keeps hitting his nose to keep it from growing
so when is that so much winning thing supposed to start
the ground is gonna open up and swallow the evil tupac shakur
last time i felt this peppy was the day of the
until we have cheaper more affordable health care with better rules

if this was an attempt to destroy trump and distant his supporters from him it didnt work speaker ryan
thought yall was talking bout kill bill fuck yall /
24 million americans can sleep easier today knowing theyre health care access isnt being ripped away tonight
for many americans its either accept the failed obamacare or be fined for not having healthcare fails
that make trump the dems biggest cheerleader because thats to their favor
ultimately though no one will have government run healthcare when the national debt hits $50 or $60 trillion and…
we need to call on all of congress to repair the aca if the gop refuses we must vote them
i made calls to states ive never visited lol
the art of the deal is to not show up
doing big things is so much harder then sitting around voting down every good thing a president of the other party proposes
retweeted lisa 🔥 the socalled closer blinked and pulled the
paul ryans aura on fleek
trump is a loser sad now focus on and
spicer at the end of the day this isnt a dictatorship weve got to expect members to vote the way they will vote duh

ill just leave this here…
thank you ever so much‼️💯❤️💛💚💙💜
feels really good to end the week with a positive bit of news for a change
time for the kind of celebratory drinking one can only do when they know theyre covered by health insurance

grassroots fought aca repeal not the dems grassroots will win the fight for universal singlepayer healthcare

was sort of hoping obamacare would be repealed given that the majority of people on it are in red states but oh well
trump care is dead obama care lives 
blaming for failed is like blaming kids if bedtime were abolished
is a terrible leader he doesnt have the respect of his colleagues &amp he doesnt know how 2 build consensus
obamacare lite was an attempt by ryan to destroy trumps presidency
i dont care who we blame for pulling the bill our government needs to get out of the insurance business
my boss coming in hot with the t e a

lives have been saved niiiice
lesson of the day works
we vetoed the goddamn bill
aw poor paul ryan it is hard to actually govern and not just obstruct governance
todays failure of my realworld counterpart and is a great victory for this country
dont worry about healthcare reform read &amp youll understand

i wonder when the will finally stop voting their conscience and just vote the party line like
before we get all stabby or gloaty because the bill died lets remember that the current system still needs fixed
17% approval rating is why they had to
gop is stuck w/ a governmentisevil narrative that voters now realize is a total sham voters love
oh im sure you will
gop voted over 60 times for a vote to repeal 30 min before vote
donald trump is about to learn the apc way that opposition and governance are two different things
will failed rest assure the will be repeat &amp replaces
rather than trying to get rid of obamacare how abt trying to fix wats broken
when ryan agreed to take speaker role he made freedom caucus promise they wouldnt give him a hard time honey moon over
have you been trying to replace obamacare for 7 years only to fail now
its easy for idiots on the hill to let die when youre not the one paying $1300 a month for a family of 4
shouldve built on there instead of hate

but look at the size of it
i love this dude so much
i have little faith after this disaster that republican congress will fulfill any of their promises speaker ryan
repubs spent first 60 days of the trump presidency screwing with health care political theater instead of doing anything real
i like my healthcare and im keeping my healthcare today was a good day
awe ill bet that hurt to say poor baby
i can get the votes nancy pelosi (whips the votes for obamacare in 2008)
republicans are moving on from repealing obamacare they are done they are moving on how about that promise now speaker ryan
you dont have the votes you dont have the votes hahaha hamilton the musical
we came close by killing the bill rather than​ allowing vote well never know if they were closeor not
this failure at policy is as uncle joe said a
just fix the aca and all will be well
bigly negotiator dropping the c in closer at every turn
ryan and trump like falcons in the super bowl major lead big fail
congrats on your 250❤️ tweet
now i get why gop hated obama so much it was because they knew he was better than them
trumps art of the deal be careful what you ask for now lets watch implode
ouch subtweet by angela chief of staff 😘
feeling salty donnie you lost big league sad
they had 8 years to come up with something better than obamacare so no i have no shits to give
👍🏻 sounds good to us
i guess this means the doomsday clock gets pushed back again
the gop complained about aca for 7 years they had 7 years to come up with a better plan and still failed
he published a book called the art of the deal then couldnt sell a gop healthcare…
this is not a lose for the gop in fact its a huge lose for reelection of many dnc seats the american people are 😡
i love poppy more all the time
rinos like ryan need to be thrown out of congress with all their demorat colleagues 
now that the ahca is dead theres more time to get back to trump  russia &amp need for special prosecutor
theres a special place in hell for paul ryan he knows what hes doing also ayn rand was a hack
unlike leftists we didnt let shit legislation pass short sighted sally speaker ryan
is anyone actually surprised that the same guy that bankrupted a casino couldnt pass a bill in a gop controlled congress
thank god some vestige of our system of govt still works so the people could
you learn something new every day today i learned that some republicans in the house of representatives actually have a spine
no this had nothing to do with the dems this was you all you
trump is letting the shitty ryan bill get blocked and ridiculed to leasen his power and will come in as
we did it safe for now

donald trump has always been a loser and always will be support him and you are also a loser
trump it was never my healthcare plan i was just repeating what paul ryan said so ok
dems need to quickly introduce bill improving aca in order to show gop and public how real governing works
gop (to we dont believe you you need more people
the people dont need trumpcare  another failed endeavor 
if we learn anything from this its that trump started a game of chicken and he ended up being the chicken
the best thumbnail goes to the german news

paul ryan makes the political failure face today
glad got to choose not to carry his own botched bill to term a mans right to choose is important and essential

this calls for a victory screech
i wish i could favorite this x24 million
trump says the losers are the democrats truly only god knows what alternate reality this guy is living in

so you and ryan didnt have plan b oh the irony
is the best thing for obamacare now insurance companies will buy in completely since repeal isnt going to happen

one of my pet peeves is that people love refer to the aca as obamacare but wont call the ahca trump care
maybe if they spent the 7 years focusing on a better health plan they could pass something today instead of smearin…
so when trump loses bigly he wears a blue tie

im not tired of winning seriously
trump would rather let obamacare explode now that victory is in place instead of fixing whats already there says it all
you dont have the republican support you liar
trump sitting at the office like
must have been all the illegal congressional voters they bussed in from massachusetts
republicans remove the whole need for insurance
ryancare was the closest thing liberals had to obamacare and theyre celebrating its failure this is why we keep winning
is he gonna repeat this in russian 
the gop tryna repeal obamacare
this is a good one  two leaders of the free world having a laugh *yes*
says let explode we had no democrat support couldnt quite get there
this bill is everything america is not
i plan to do *both* kinda like resisting trumps agenda over many things at the same time
theres no plan b awesome

trumps supporters want to seenobama care repealed and replaced with a free market solution game on
trump just blamed ds for not supporting bill how about the rs who didnt support it your own party couldnt agree
when you realize you failed bigly on your most hefty campaign promise
add amendments like no free ride for illegals to limit losses
ppl who only want to pay for ins they will use realize we live in a country where you cant pay for just espn right

we should not lose sight of the republicans that were ready vote for this terrible legislation
what was that was that the sound of obamacare exploding or trumps bp going through the roof
go suck a big one now ryan
or whatever its called is a disasterthank god is gone is a dream is
who knew being president could be so complicated
still waiting on all that winning
how bad is potus vs ryan going to look ryan had 7 years potus 7 weeks
and a lot of people will not be dead way to go fellow dems
nobody knew [passing a] health care [bill] could be so complicated
guess that list can go in the shredder now
so far hasnt been in office for 100 days yet and he just keeps losing
7 years 7 years to replace a law they call a death chamber &amp they cant even vote for their own plan
would love to invite you to my kindergarten class so my ss can teach you how to lose gracefully

of note hes calling reporters at outlets before making a public statement whats up with that 😉 😂…
now they want to blame the democrats 😂😂😂
no it was not close you are a loser and a liar  dont blame the democrats for your own stupidity
gop would rather see aca fail than work with the dems to fix the issues so sad and spiteful thats why they failed today
the pulling of the horrible bill is the first win but unlike what once said im not tired of winning yet
trump right now and hopefully until his impeachment
the government shouldnt be involved in healthcare to begin with
trump the first thing i am going to do is repeal obamacare response
thank you to everyone who called congress today we made our voices heard for the 30 milion americans with
blaming the dems for no votes uh ok big shoots
we were very close… it was a very tight margin… is exploding…
we love yall dont stop
you done good party of lincoln
another failure for self proclaimed great negotiator donald trump and stupid idiot paul ryan
and then get popcorn and watch kill bill vol 1 and 2
starts with let it explode and sulking about no democratic support what a sore ass loser
now says obamacare will exploderead that as i and the gop will do everything we can to undermine it
the gop and put ryan out to pasture
this gives paul ryan more time to get back to what hes truly good at waxing that creepy little windows peak
why does think that democrats were required to support his bill he couldnt get the support of the gop
my cousin and i say this all the time gurrrllllll
by morning i expect a tweet saying that healthcare will be paid for by a nigerian prince
if the 2nd &amp 3rd phases were so good why split them up and loose it on the 1st
really great plan cant pass a bill but blame dems really we dont pass 3 phases bills put in one bill
you know a lot of people fail after formulating a plan for 7 years i know theyre called republicans…
so lets see draining the swamp fail muslimban 1&amp2 fail&ampfail mexico paying for the wall fail obamacare replacement fail
congrats ocare safe and all u had to do is give ppl a taste of hc &amp u knew they wldnt let go
you may have that backwards actually it was the right that wanted to trump was with ryan &amp moderates on this
no one does subtlety quite like the 👏😄
he said the same sentences twice in a different way
and they will try again end their income that ends their reelection ryan…
you cant really call it health care reform when you kind of forgot the health part
when your goal is to screw over a majority of the country it should be hard it also shouldnt happen…
fake presidents dont get to put fake healthcare through fake vetting that hurts real americans sit down trump the resistance
knowing aca needs improvement why isnt our potus trying to help us improve it they can fix it we know whats wrong…
when the gets killed the same day as movie comes out
man for those of you who voted for trump tired of winning yet
the only thing exploding is the failure of this whitehouse and the gop
music to our ears for the foreseeable future americans will retain the basic human right to health care…
said that he learned a lot about loyalty through this processis that a veiled threat to defecting republicans
no tears for this death

is a in a bigly way sad lmao
im just rting for the gif lol
how can trump even begin to blame the dems when you had enough people to pass it without them denial is a helluva drug
trump doesnt care about you
hey gop heres an idea how about universal care oh wait that would stop the money flow from your medical insurance cronies
you had one job ryan  but you cant seem to produce legislation without socialism and let die on its own
im still not going to the doctor but nice to know i can (still kind of) afford to
we learned a lot about loyalty so by your own words donald you should be blaming gop not dems
trump blaming democrats and speaking of future regulations blah blah fail reality tv president (not russia democracy)

looking so happy with speaker ryan &amp failure 2 replace obamacare with trumpcare art of the deal
the art of the kvetch
turns out that vindictiveness &amp incompetence arent sufficient ingredients for major legislation
hey ryan see the big bus speeding away you were just thrown under it
we learned a lot about loyaltytrump on losing healthcare billsounds like some people are about to get suicided
do you agree with the decision to pull the trump care bill
their ideas appear to be terrible
promised so much winning today hardworking american families won
if republicans werent clowns they should work on fixing instead of replacing itidiots
can we finally put to rest it got whipped by a more bigly movement
when youre obsessed with coffee
7 years to write a new bill and they decided to cram last night gop couldnt pass an sat right now
listening to trump speak is mind numbing
trump says im a team player i tried bigly good and i learned how a fucking bill works seriously that happened
insurance companies are going to have to suck it up &amp stay in the market or be out of business
it reads like poetry (with unicorns)
wait for it is about to go in
uh guys potus just admitted he learned the bill passing process he found it interesting smh
trump blames the dems for no support on his failed health care bill ignores fact reps didnt buy it either
amem tell it like it is

speaker ryan finally told the gut level on who to blame for the shape of the usa ho…
it wouldve been political suicide for house republicans and trump to push that healthcare bill through…

if aca crumbles its the gops fault they promised tax cuts for insurance companies who left acathey failed
thank you for fighting to myself and my fellow georgians are lucky to have you representing us

its called the affordable care act not obamacare i think trump is imploding not the aca
you have a house majority you cannot blame dems
from i alone can fix it to i worked as a key player dude youre the president
hey how about put your big girl panties on and actually sit down with the dems and compromise
blames for failures i thank the democrats for supporting the people
says obamacare was rammed down everyones throat took 18 months to pass trump care attempt 7 weeks
remember americans we taxpayers pay the salaries healthcare &amp pensions for the grifters in congress we deserve healthcare
you know this is happening
cant accuse dems of this not passing when reps hold the majority your plan failed because it sucked
the man is an idiot you cant dispute that and now its all the fault
who knew healthcare could be so complicated
donald trump is the stephen a smith of presidentsain never done nothing will never do nothing but sure can tal…
okay you cant expect votes from dems when you dont work with them &amp demand things your one sided way
trumpcare is here thank you for taking over the new law of the land
there are things trump didnt particularly love but we also didnt get to see how fantastic thus bill was hes an idiot
republicans are sooooooo screwed now
is 0 for 1 nice promise kept
and what happened then well in dc they say – that the grinchs massive ego shrank three sizes that day…
dear and close only counts in horseshoes and hand grenades sad losers
part of tax reform is screwed healthcare bill meant to provide huge tax reduction for top 1% now not happening
pelosi is the real loser here
on apprentice project manager should be responsible dt as president not my fault democracts fault
you will never be as great as this man is ever will prevail…
why did it take 5 questions (with trump blaming dems) for somebody to tell trump bill could have passed with just gop votes
trump is actually blaming the democrats for his and pauls incompetence hahahahahahaha
and comes out like the dems had actually stopped the and from oc…
is butt hurt haha he is a divider he couldnt repeal obamacare and is mad bro
i dont like losers ok i like people who win like obama ok is a loser
we the ppl will ensure sits a grand jury jails feloneous leakers &amp mishandlers of classified info &amp…
paul ryan splatoon 2 house republicans
there is a pretty clear path to insure all americans &amp lower healthcare costs a system
breaking healthcare bill is pulled causing paul ryan to suffer from groin pains
wouldve been cool if gave his surrender speech at the appomattox court house
a great wake up call for  you cant ask russia to interfere with senate and house voting
cool guy alert gets shit done
now that has survived repeal will any vulnerable red state governors try to take medicaid expansion
is this about bill english
let us continue fighting patriots
getting pwned such an embarrassment to our great state of oregon vote him out
you have the majority and killed your own bill sad
no trump aca wasnt rammed down peoples throat thats what you and ryan tried to do with tryancare
i agree 1000% paul ryan is a traitor i trust rand paul to do whats right
im going back to my sandbox to bully people whaa wha wha

trump is the biggest sore loser ever saying health care to explode because you didnt win your a 2yr old
obamacare rammed down everyones throats without any republicans  just said w/o hint of irony
did dt just say it was really hard whenever you have no democrat support really i guess obama was a negotiator
a little insight into how and why got flushed
now when completely implodes as forecasted there will be more leverage for full repeal for the best
the repeal bill wasnt short on votes it was short on leadership public support and morality
comrade trump the democratic party will not solve your healthcare woes
i cant take all of this winning
is already a republican health care we need singlepayer medicareforall now
artists x tv shows x commercials looking for the hottest instrumentals
the wheels on the bus go round and round round and round  the wheels on the bus go round and round all over paul ryan
we dems will proudly take credit for but lets remember your triple majority
good question here did pay for this advertisement hope not because im pretty sure that isnt allowed 🤔
🙄 rand is in it for 2020
how can something implode and explode 🤔

the democrats now own this disastrous health care law

some salesman your fingerprints are all over this failure noob art of the deal lol…

4 more years of everything is obamas fault when will 45s fans realize all his administration can do is spin
shorter better bill butter up buttercup bull bill better butter bull bill
the scene outside the whitehouse right now
and thank for not letting that happen
could someone remind me how many republicans voted for obamacare
lost plain and simple b/c gop is incompetent they control and but dont get governing
hey republicans dont worry that burn is covered under the affordable care act
trump slept with dogs and got fleas
trump says explode your the only one thats going to
i cant believe trumps blaming democrats for his new health care plan when it failed because of his own party
glad to see trump isnt fucking around with kids who dont know how to act like adults move on time to build that wall
didnt the president just say he never said repealandreplace i am confused
trump not such a deal maker so much for the art of the deal
and fuck this white dude for his condescending implication that black male anger is inappropriate
i hope this is whats going on
so basically after trying to just ram shit through trump is groveling to the democrats for help
excellent rino care is defeated we now get to sit back and watch obamacare explode and the democrat party owns it
hey this is what a winner looks like blame dems all you want gop failed…

¡amiga guerrera we couldnt do it w/out you it is

this should be our rebel cry
im upset about the arcane rules too the arcane electoral college is the only thing that has you in office
so that whole promise from is yet another broken one
but unfortunately the suckers who voted for still drink the kookaid
this wuss is still talking about clinton

he talks about like its just been passed i hope it does wel
yeah lets blame the dems when you couldnt get enough republican votessounds legit

obama worked for 13 months to get aca passed trump spent the last 7 weekends golfing on our dime and is already giving up
donald trump is quickly finding out that the world doesnt actually revolve around him
today we averted catastrophe but healthcare problems still exist we can fix most of these problems with

donald trumps oval office conference i never said in 64 days

thank god for the representatives that voted in the interest of their constituents and against their party
this shit is disturbing i cant spot a single minority

paul ryan is a complete failure lolololol
blame it on the dems when you didnt even try to work with the dems
wow who wouldve thought that my dad is still an icon
didnt do bipartisan now bipartisanship all of a sudden is important
can the gov just get their shit together and think about the people instead of worrying if their party will win…
its appalling how the left refuses to acknowledge the fact that is failing it is just a matter of time ryan
the amount of bs that spews out of his mouth how does melania kiss him
republicans tried to use their healthcare bill as a disguise for major tax breaks for the rich
bitch you thought obamacare is here to stay deal with it
just let collapse &amp wait for to come begging
 senator bob menendez had the quote of the day

only a damn dummy would think would vote against their own bill r all losers
trump is on tv trying to blame if fails dont forget trump ended mandate w/ eo
the orange prick decides to pull out and not screw with the american people
looks like you didnt get your way now go ahead and whine like the little baby you are
trump will console his loss by playing golf and not knowing a fuckin thing about the bill or what just happened
this bill was very very good the next will be very very very good  donnie trump
lol governing is hard donny bullying is easy
mad got no support from but what did he expect didnt consult with them sad
havent seen msm ever critically analyze or talk about any horror stories full repeal is best route

the more things change the more things stay the same
yes and dont forget stuff like the usfl that he had a notable hand in screwing up and then just walked away )
failure of health care bill is an indictment of gop leadership
what a pussy he just blamed the democrats republicans got smart you dumbass they killed
🤡 is trying 2 &amp his way out of yet &amp say the will its the dems fault
not because obamacare is great but because ahca bill doesnt repeal that pos
i was looking forward to seeing the bill pass so that trumpsters realize just how big a piece of shit trump is
nothing interesting about terrorizing people health this was a terrifying experience for the of this country…
campaigning to smear one woman is easy governing is hard
trump said he was going to repeal and replace the aca his first day in office and now he saying he didnt say that
one of the many bills that wont be passed this term
if we had bipartisan i think we could have had healthcare that was the ultimate president trump what a wordsmith
meanwhile the rest of us cant afford to use our insurance
i agree republicans attempt to harm their own constituents will continue

i think its great dems still own obamacare let it blow up before next election
correct said hed repeal and replace it immediately lolz
but the president is said to be agitated by the process an aide said which he thinks is all political
trump is blaming dems for his horrible healthcare bill not passing even though republicans hold the house senate &amp…
trump i never said repeal and replace it within 65 days *i have a long time* [maybe you shouldnt be so sure about that 😬]
paul shouldve just read twitter  theres millions of people here that know exactly what to do
trump democrats rammed down obamacare on us and the gop tried to do the same and failed
nobody knew that passing a law could be so complicated  trump right now
pressure works we did it republicans and democrats all over the country fought back &amp made our voices heard…
so glad we dont have a majority in the house or the senate to take action on healthcare
needs to ask for his money back from whatever fancy school his parents sent him to
you cannot rush and push through new legislation you have to get a majority of its users onboard first
trump here i am pretending to sign the obamacare replacement law
when failure stood fast in his way sir donald turned tail and ran away there nver was a loser as sad (and weak) as sir donald

whare is all the winng you keep losing mister president you have done nothing
blows my mind that what killed bill was it wasnt harsh enough thanks freedom caucus youve saved lives
sometimes pulling out is the best option when youre in a pickle
the ahca was the abusive boy friend the aca is the person who introduced you and single payer is the front door
we must learn anew how to fight this war this enemy
we forget that donald trump was talking about moral victories when he talked about all these wins he would get
the fact the aca repeal failed is amazing news
you would think those republicans given 8 years could come up with a replacement for obamacare useless
lesson ⚡️ paul ryan obamacare is the law of the land
there are two lines one understands the difference between entitlements and handouts
how do you feel about gerrymandering now
it seems that couldnt get his health care bill passed so he just pulled it
when you pull out cause you dont have a plan b do better gop 
we could deliver a much better healthcare reform bill
 agreed this is your chance help improve it and show the gop how to govern of/by/…
my face when i hear trump blaming democrats

it is heartening when the lunatic fringe cannot move forward
today the american people won not the republicans not the democrats the citizens thats how we beat these bastards

i never said repeal and replace
 i thought we were going to be winning winning winning all the time oops

i hope so well soon find out
to make today extra fun look up to see the contortions that this crowd is capable of
i bet this guy is stoked right now maybe gop will listen to him
this is especially relevant right now
dirtbag whining like a little girl &amp blaming everyone else but himself
blame paul ryan and vp pence not the democrats

dont let this man have anything to do with your health
hey i know a real president and an intelligent woman who know how to get things done

you are going to need congressional approval and you dont have the votes
i thought agent orange &amp rethuglicans were against abortionsoh well
trump yes giving huge tax cuts to billionaires while poor people struggle is much more easy
thank you to bernie sanders elizabeth warren and all who refused to vote yes on the aca bill
the silver lining on is all these democarats rejoicing will still have to own this miserable failure of obamacare
pres trump in the end i think its gonna be an experience that leads to an even better health care plan…
i hope you all have a real plan because they are only going to come harder from here on out
nancy pelosi &amp chuck schumer win bc didnt want to kill 24m but yes needs to improve
if cant see that cares nothing about the by not fixing healthcare you are truly blind
now we need the insurance companies sorted out so we have doctors to go to
to all you democrats happy about wanna watch obamacare implode rep arent bunch of sheep who passes the bill then read it
trump is more than an idiot hes an imbecile puppet stooge doofus traitor bully pedophile rapists racist…
today is a good day its friday and we made a victory
this is so funny to me 😂😂
i thought trump said obamacare wld be replaced the first week of his administration damn hippocrates been on this…
dont 4get those mashed potatoes
what this has showed us is trump cannot work with his fellow republicans
youre gonna need congressional approval and you dont have the votes
republicans and trump take the biggest l of the year
insurers are to blame for exchanges difficulties congress needs to force insurers to curb their greed &amp spite
thank you for speaking up &amp getting involved savor this victory
take a nap these days and the whole country goes to hell the bill was pulled what
you are a great man thank you
i think this will give you a chuckle have a nice day
cant blame the dems when youre party is in control
*epic* game of telephone healthcare bill
dont let this man have anything to do with your health
amazing the immaturity that displayed by trying to put his crippling defeat on dems he chose not to work with
this is *almost* the first real win since president troll took office i say almost because there was no gain just sustained😕
speaker paul ryan actually said this
the people who wanted to dont have ocare its horrible unless you get medicaid and dont care about anyone else
stuart varney goes ballistic over republican disgrace
all hail the gilded gelding still cuckold by having shoved down his throat

but mostly to all of you
republicans blew a 31 lead
i make the best deals folks
now i understand his reasons
when trump says obamacare is going to explode what he mean is we are going to sabotage it out of spite
id consider this a win for america
all thumbs up here 👍👍👍👍👍 ryan falling off ladder bannon most likely gleeful cause he dislikes ryan
im also happy and the house republicans decided not to force a terrible repeal
would somebody please get a thesaurus already bad very bad explode implode
no its not stop doing this
obamacare cant be repealed until replaced people were put into aca with preexisting conditions covered by other insurance

thank you to all who voted against the bill appreciated so much was only for the rich
as for congrats on being the intellectual leader of the worlds most intellectually inept political movement
at the very least were aware 45 isnt pretending he cares about the people in the usa
trump blames the democrats not speaker ryan and of course not himself it was the people who opposed this bill remember that
i think it was suicide no cure for bad haircuts
get rid of this scam as only cares about his name being put on something
thats rich good riddance to the disaster
 lesson 2 it is always worthwhile to make your opinions known to congress &amp to remind them whom they work for
trumps attempt wasnt going 2do any better even a lot of rep saw thatthey shouldnt rush next time
i feel a tiny bit of my constant anxiety shifting away today thank you average americans for exercising democracy
a great day for dems gop fails bc they have no vision
i am glad d trump did not win he is just a liar and nothing he says you can believe its bad for america and rapes the poor

americans voted for not obamacare 20 paul ryan and the gop snakes forget who they are working for
well djt was right we will get so tired of winning
im so happy death bill was defeated today
heres to trump and the gop
this sentiment was too funny and too true not to rt &amp
trump blames democrats for not voting for the plan that was trying to replace the plan that his party voted against 60 times
in the not so distant future trump is going to make all of the naysayers look foolish as he does every time
the so spectacularly well thought out it couldnt even cover its own life support
this is working we must persist

what an idiot what a loser sad
the democrats still own the disaster known has obamacare enjoy
see u in court 😭😭😭😭😭 nah🤕🤕🤕
maybe 45 didnt have the right woman for the job
boy look at his chin💀😂
forgive my ignorance but if the bill is withdrawn does that mean its dead or can it be resubmitted at a later date

first months were great why go back to failed strategies that gave obamacare in the first place
to everyone who fought to make sure this bill wouldnt pass this victory belongs to you this is our night and our victory
obamacare is catastrophic health insurance not like teachers or state workers get
repeal and replace more like reveal and disgrace now about that budget

years and years of gop rhetoric and now that its their turn they cant even do shit
hopefully now they can focus on fixing the problems with the affordable care act though i doubt theyll do anything
remember those promises i had no idea winning looked this bad how sad
i hate yall so much lmao
