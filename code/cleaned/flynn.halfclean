reeling in wake of resignation via
back in undergrad i had summer jobs that lasted longer than michael flynns job as national security advisor
the resignation is red meat to antitrumpers a rally to the call for his rabid fans and barely registering/understood by the rest
the look on face when says lets move on from flynn resignation
there is no question brought gen down
gave his 3 weeks after ag told him he was compromised by the messenger was shot
you shared north korea intel with random dinner guests with flashlight apps dont act concerned
dont want to look into involvement with but would rather find who leaked it to press unbelievable
yes but the haters are still ahead by so many points real people have a lot of catching up to do
so when are the hearings
you get what you give
cnn reporting house intel chief wont probe trump over but wants inquiry into leaks that led to
id just like to remind folks that we havent even reached day 30 and we already have scandal and resignation
did someone say treason was
lawmakers rush to the defense of knew he was doing it
mccain sure does say a lot while doing nothing
this is blatant cya but theyve fooled their blind followers so far can they do it again no
there is no question brought gen down
so its not illegal or unethical if no one knows about it no trump investigation but those leaks are really concerning
dt not only stole election he kept us from havg most qualified pres ever lock them up lock them
facts had highest clearancehistory of divulging sensitive info what else was shared
even if this diaper dump were true what would it say about a natsec advisor who couldnt fend off a blog attack
i imagine this debacle really put a damper on trumps vladentines day celebrations
are americans going to stand by as refuses to probe re scandal pay u
cant believe lauer has the cahoots to ask a tough question  hes a fluff guy

its clear that once investigation is finished he will be given immunity if his testimony can deliver

the press smells blood and are going in hard at this press briefing rn
resignation is prob just the beginning how deep do you think it goes hoping not as deep as sec of ed
hey sean spicer read my lips bullshit
 question not if its illegal only the loss of trust had no problem doing his jobthats what ns advisor does
please investigate &amp others the safety &amp security of our country supersedes political parties &amp politics
basically just said trump wasnt so bothered talking sanctions w/russiafact he lied to pence was why he fired ok
or the 9 or so months we know worked for the campaign (at least) complicit
i just want to apologize to the for this piece of
so the only thing that matters is whether theres a aspect not too priority fuck you
 question not if its illegal only the loss of trust had no problem doing his jobthats what ns advisor does
it came down to trust and treason but why would spicer mince words at a time like this
level of trust in that is not going to cut a deal to testify against trump in impeachment

wow more problems to come for in case gen
its what all liars do especially the liar who plotted the treasonous act &amp gave the ok
this is astute stuff 😁
the sanctimony &amp hypocrisy spewing from the left regarding resignation is nauseating
trying to watch without gagging
needs to explain why was recorded lol because of the national security maybe
this is the real story seems isnt quite happening
you are million percent does not resolve the problem do your job
it took 3+ week for trump to decide was a trust issue national security 3 weeks
violating the logan act is part of job 
lest we new russia adviser has deep ties 2 kremlins gazprom via
there was outrage but not among democrats and media (same thing) the left are hypocritices

sean spicer trying to explain resignation is a complete fail congress needs a bipartisan full on ties to russia
no dont get into thinking he does not think thought he was getting away w/what learned on 1/23 out
breaking flynn was out because it was all about trust
remember sally yates she warned the trump admin about possible ties to russia  2 weeks ago
was it part of flynns job to lie to the american people
i really feel for spicer on some levels it must be so tiring to go out and knowingly lie nonstop
but didnt resign without pressure from im so confused spicey
how stupid do you think are on phone promising to lift sanctions they have…
spicer declines to go into what led to change in trust in between yesterday (monday) morning and evening
resignation likely the beginning of russia woes – not the end
u have to wonder who gave the ok to talk to the russians so many times this must be thoroughly investigated
it looks like 2017 is going to be a great year
what in gods name is blathering about that was the most long winded pile of hot garbage nonanswer ive ever heard
the issue facing the administration appears to be that no one realized the phone call between &amp the russian ambassador was recorded
sure it was a difficult decision on
no issue re what he discussed only issue lost trust of have eroding trust 4 you
calm down you can get your point across without looking &amp sounding like you want to start a fight
so one of your key cabinet members has deep ties to russia what do you do
proof positive pence (and trump) knew flynn liedand lied to cover it up
i need spicys press briefing to be good today come thru for me &amp please explain the debacle as only you can😉
just made my call and was told they are receiving a very high amount of phone calls keep calling its our future…
gonna need a new twitter handle come 2018 or something idk just spitballing
is the fall guy the is getting murkier by the minute let flynn go only because they were caught
how do you sleep at night remember your oath to uphold
can you say asked/answered allowing reporters to ask same question 12x &amp answering same 12x is total waste of time
love how my babies are avenging the shit out of life right now 😍
reiterates that it was who asked for and received resignation multiple reports say it was who made call

i think this trust is talking about means trust=getting caught you know 45 told you dummy not smart enough to be spy
spicer trump had no issue with doing his job but with inaccurate report he knew that in dec whyd he screw pence/spicer/priebus
dif between today if was a appointee would b flipping out &amp many liberals would agree
throwing all including kitchen sink in presser to divert attention from cover up
the double standards are mind numbing
why are you saying resigned was fired
adds insult to injury wants rational people to believe only out because outted in
the evolving situation of general position from full confidence to being fired
if there was no legal issueif it was his job then why did lie about it
the prez asked for resignation i thot said he resigned
says didnt violate but doesnt say why he and were both private citizens at the time
spicer once again asking ppl to defy logic reality and facts
only work for public🙄no respect for law no wheres the $$ trail
logan act what did was treason see and understand what happened
his personal agenda mattered more to him than national security and they say hes not really a republican
ted kennedy did worst to reagan
what happens when you lose trust in the president should i be asking for his resignation
remember sally yates she warned the trump admin about possible ties to russia  2 weeks ago
general flynn tweets that he is a scapgoat scapgoat for whom is the question
taking on the hard questions today its bad enough he has to defend the president now he has to defend
michael resigned heres why he still needs to be investigated
so sean  had trumps trust until what  he saw them even have qs about russia on fox ne…
says asked to step down because he misled maybe it was because he promised sanctions lift
spicey its all about trustan evolving and eroding process
says thats his job but also that it was an evolving situation that trust has eroded but served this country admirably
its all about trust confidence that trust erodednothing did was a violation of any sortill say again
says trump made a decision  as he regularly does its scary that he has to clarify that
press sec doubles down saying did not break law by talking w/

spicer trump didnt tell flynn to discuss sanctions come onlets be real didnt do this on his ownw/out prompting from above

doj told 45 a month ago that was vulnerable to blackmail the only reason hes now gone is because of media reporting
was well within his duties lol
amen trump had to know something  maybe its time for to start talking where is your honor sir save america from trump
all this is it was legal there is nothing the general did that was a violation of any sort soindependent investigation
anyone who believes didnt know about discussing sanctions also probably believes the earth is flat
absolutely only guy at top gives the command ☝️🍊🤡
theres nothing that the general did that was a violation of any sortwhat this came down to was a matter of trust on
sean spicer as always is 100 percent correct and that what he said is true and important stephen miller
come on had no duties before inaugerated but had duty to american people and he failed
spicer says chats w/russia routine then why did justice department warn was at risk to be compromised / blackmailed
nothing the general did was in illegal this was a matter of trust = we will not be investigating jack $hit

according to it took the 20 days to lose trust in after being told he was not to be trusted
says that nothing that did was a violation of any sort says otherwise
your lack of trust in came too late and is nothing compared to lack of trust in you
so why isnt this on msm instead of made up treason by
more like out like amirite
sashay shashay dance spicey dance
first now you can &amp by resigning too also invest in wrinkle creme &amp therapy
sean spicer thinks if he yells that words will seem true trust
keeps saying that there was nothing illegal about what said methinks he dost protest too much
press just asked spicer if it was hard for trump to let go and spicer answers as if that was a true statement he resigned
spicer says was well within his duties when he spoke to russian ambassador before january 20th
lies lies  all lies all colluded with
it came down to a matter of trust doesnt it always
has a choice stay on his sword or tell the must have told to repeat trust ad nauseam
oh its ok u guys the issue was just the erosion of trust on part &amp not just that the media found out
seems to be the same as susan rice lying to the american people about benghazi
retweeted jordan uhl spicer trump wasnt counseled on by ag pick sessions b/c of delayed
no  you dont get to determine legality of behavior congress &amp/or judiciary will
the gop does not want to look behind the curtain at the mess of their own making

what happens when you lose trust in the president should i be asking for his resignation
and stress that they dont mind that spoke about sanctions just that he lied to pence huh
fired as us ditches no turning back now either russian rapprochement or regional war
nothing the general [ did was in violation of his duties  sean spicer
yeah i always lose trust in people who do their job right and act in accord
lets explore if the long overdue sanctions were put in place to create this kerfuffle
so concluded he trusted until it became public that everyone knew about poss blackmail of flynn weeks ago
i really used to enjoy now i just like watching their outrage at what they helped cause
sean keeps saying pure and simple nothing pure or simple about resignation
with any luck will soon be there
who needs late night comedy when you have coming out doing his daily joke routine 🇷🇺

spicer trump had no issue with doing job but w/ inaccurate report he knew that in dec why mislead pence/spicer/priebus &amp public
pres led the way for to undermine our with hack invitation the rest of the camp is just following suit
telling the world that is a honerable man did nothing wrong
so didnt do anything illegal but he lied to the veep and thats why he was canned bull shit
sean spicer accidentally spoke the truth trump aides russia
trusted that flynn would not get caught oops
i think what spicey is trying to say is that it came down to an issue of trust
what are the odds that looked at and said michael youre fired 21
says nothing did was wrong only trust issue yeh distrust of the whole nation and of president oh vomit
doj told 45 a month ago that was vulnerable to russian blackmail only reason hes now gone is because of media reporting
repeated spoke to counterparts for different countriesglad he said that release the names of those countriesback it up
my friends urge you to write your own representatives about see mine to reps

on talking abt trust &amp really heres billy joels stupid matter of trust for stupid 45 regime

spicer is laying down the law right now no laws broken trust &amp loyalty was the issue lied he died
putin told to say that because hillary is all that stood between putin and trillions 💰 trump swamp was in…
you say the matter was a matter of trust your news briefing is a matter of trust also &amp your explanations unbelievable
you cant whitewash this just watch what happens after you finish this briefing
the plot thickens potus 45
im confused absolutely did not discuss sanctions (despite intel) also says this was about trust &amp misleading others
there is nothing that said on that call which caused an issue even doesnt know what was said on that call
how did president lose trust in if as you say did not break the law confusing
it used to be in like now someone isnt playing the game tsk tsk uk miles better no really just meet our speaker
again why would call russia &amp discuss sanctions just up &amp decided to do it uh huh
shoutout to and those telling us to stay on russia flynns just the beginning
says absolutely did not tell to bring up on call
well this is awkward particularly at 145
review by council was very through on
said that it wasnt what did but that he misled the vice president
wasnt national security when calls with russia he was yet to be approved by = he was civilian
everyday checking twitter trends is like finding additional cracks in the liberty bell
it could happen pt deux
says there was nothing that did in his conduct that was wrong then why is he resigning
lets explore if the long overdue sanctions were put in place to create this kerfuffle
baghdad sean spicer up there spouting more alternative facts
nothing did was a violation of any sort
its a matter of trust so says a trust that eroded over the course of 3 hrs when knew about for 17 days
press should incite logan act when talking to spicer
now im confused did know nothing about or was he following it closely which is the lie hes telling america
nah the real story here is that youre a traitor to our country
does the president hope to cooperate with were going to comply with the law no issue of law
the feeling when youve run out of lies 🤥 cant spin this
when gets subpoenaed for an investigation and he willhes gonna cry
abcs asks why took 3 weeks to fire after being warned he could be subject to bl…
not an issue of law but an issue of trust or nah
trump was fine with the whole mess until the found out
didnt the show the report of to the too
there was nothing in what did in terms of conducting himself that was an issue what it came down to was misleading vp
dont broke the law crazy when he talk he was not at the just follow instructions from
doj told 45 a month ago that was vulnerable to blackmail the only reason hes now gone is because of media reporting
was for 24 days thats the duration of a christmas advent calendar
correct made it clear the issue was lying to pence not what he lied about arrogance
white house council concluded conclusively come on
the horrible part of the story is how yates was fired for telling the president the truth about flynn
most likely could no longer act on potuss personal behalf his cover had been blown
if did nothing wrong why the need to lie
putin &amp russian politicians have flynns back too
spicer literally just said the issue is not what he discussed the issue is whether or not he informed the vice president wow
roses are red violets are blue god bless the and the too
of course trumps ability to judge genius is  any national security experts want to weigh in on that
hire scummy reality tv star 4 potus and u get a scummy potus whose govt is like scummy reality tv
this is an issue of treason not trumps trust in someone regardless if spicer says trust 1000 times
roses are red violets are blue why doesnt speaker investigate the debacle too
level of trust = got caught redhanded  whereas has yet to be
knew about dealing with whats the point of doing it if its not at the presidents request
wh pres sec currently lying to media and millions of americans
oh what a tangled web we weave when first we practise to deceive
apparently potus trust in eroded faster than the soil under the oroville dam cause conway said he had full confidence yesterday

russia has reportedly fired a cruise missile if true we will find out exactly how compromised president trump is
this incompetent crooks not only lie to the people they also lie to each other
spicer denies trump asked to talk to russians about sanctions
after a decade of donald trump publicly firing people the media is in a frenzy over president trump firing people
so it was fine that lied to the public &amp gave the russians classified infobut its the that he lied to trump is why he was canned
cant even get their stories to match up
roses are red  bramhall…
it was not an issue of law it was an issue of trust
this little chipmunk has got lots of nuts around him but he doesnt have 2 of his own
the question is when will throw under the bus its coming
ok i have it now was not wrong 4 discussing sanctions its because he got caught yup got it
in the you are fired
fair to wonder why potus confidence wasnt lost when told on 12/29 of call
snapshot we wait and see what the truth will be 🙏
it was not travels or known actions abroad that concern but rather flynn misleading the vp
justice dep warned that could be vulnerable to russian blackmail officials say…
regarding resignation of  discussing sanctions with a russian ambassador isnt a scandal sorry
ajplus remember sally yates she warned the trump admin about possible ties to russia  2 weeks ago
more smoking guns than thee ok corral

hey your ride is here
only b/c 4th estate is doing your job for you

is back reminds us how &amp son dug their own graves by spreading evil lies about her &amp others lol
after complete legal review wh counsel found no legal issue because krauthammer decision to fire was a trust issue

can we get trending cc
wait a minute trump fired for an erosion of trust can we fire trump
so says it was only a matter of trust nothing was illegal about what did
one weak piss poor question after another spicer presser
 just a few notes further to flynns resignation theres a lot of information swirling around and i read
it was a matter of trust that led to flynn being asked to resignmore likely could no longer due bidding exposed
in the middle of questions about spicer just threw it to a local fox affiliate in vegas to ask about economic regulations
really owes royalties for this press briefing
 nothing wrong with content of convo w  only problem was failure to tell check
sean spicer accidentally spoke the truth trump aides russia
blames flynns fall on… anyone but via
distraction attempt stay focused stop chasing squirrels
although this could just be a one time thing far too early to know if its the beginning of a pattern
spicer keeps saying was not about law but about trust flynn did nothing wrong as it relates to the law so the logan act
the question is who paid for flynns trips to russia
if as did not discuss sanctions therefore did not have anything to lie aboutwhat broke trust &amp how did he mislead /2
needs to be investigated who knew when who authorized his actions
and now we will take a question from skype that has nothing to do with
bbc news  michael resignation he to says white house / i am surprised  the president was misled
the first issue is trust in national security &amp knew 3 weeks ago lied whats to evaluate…
this is disgraceful to say what scumbags
teddy bear negligee or box of chocolates for from of course d) all of the above is logical choice
shadow men (informal club of intelligence operatives)work to remove president trump warned in jan
someone let me off this crazy orange train i want to go back to the real world please
what did know and when did he know it
the reason and dont want further investigation liars
the white house counsel concluded conclusively to the conclusion oh melissa you slay me
the reason and dont want further investigation liars
this is 1 of those new wave smart memes
it was not an issue of law but trust on
there is no way he did this was a
oh you meant the russian constitution
trump failed terribly in applying his extreme to
resignation  a matter of trust what does mean
as the wall comes tumbling down we need to help it along call your representatives make your voices heard
spicer let go b/c of a trust issue conway has full confidence in general flynn
how long till the administration collapses
as far as i am concerned trump made a mistake giving in to the msm dems and elite republicans the smell of blood is in the water
wh discussing sanctions not a problem but lying to pence was wow flynn committed a treasonous act dont lose track of facts
yes may i repeat yes senate calls for russiatrump probe &amp wants to testify this would be under oath
blow out of proportions dont let the left fake media keep this going time to turn focus on dems now
treason against the united states
politics is a filthy nasty dangerous and backstabbing business
president trump always did and always will want loyal people around him trump is a winner and always will be
everyone else doesnt trust gets berated with insults but did his job and was a good general for his country
if sally yates is the leak she should be disbarred and face criminal charges

same old story same old song and dance
it would appear that the white house is compromised by the russians

as ive said before when u barter with the enemy he will collect is collecting from the top down the unraveling continues
so lying to was the real issue not the fact that was committing treason &amp speaking to as a private citizen mmm ok
i am sure and knew about this months ago
investigate them all please for the love of humanity
proof of timeline is necessary
if was honest when asked if he discussed sanctions with  he would still have his job
current pres of usa imposes sanctions flynn supposedly goes rouge &amp calls r to undermine sanctions &amp thats

soooooowhen it heats up at the press briefing they go to a puffball skype questionoh please snlget on that
in like has a whole new meaning
so hasnt done anything illegal but its too sensitive to talk about it i am so confused (oo)
proud of the at note trust in eroded btwn appearance on tv yesterday &amp 11p
told weeks ago that michael withheld truth on
supposedly asked for resignation due to trust issues i believe we the people have the right to ask the same of him
when do we get an investigation into the leaks and treasonous comments to russia
bring back hes ours we forgive &amp move on
absolutely outrageous we wont stand for this
of course didnt just learn about lies to he was apprised of it weeks ago whyd it take this long to fire him
ill be calling within the hour
is a casualty of our previous loving cia chief time to the swamp
so you can follow discussion of dates admin knew from flynn was vulnerable
problem some scapegoats sing so look for a $10mil deposit in fs account &amp/or a tracheotomy
just said has been reviewing the issue daily for weeksthen why did deny knowledge 4
am i the only one thinking god is going to have an amazing episode coming up just me
if trump fired because of deteriorated trust then why did he wait three weeks to do it spicer says trump was briefed jan 26
  what we do know is lt gen flynn was not wholly accurate (omission carelessness whatever) in his
going back and forth between blaming/congratulating for misconduct/delay in resignationyeah ok
no not moving on endured 11 hrs of q
we never knew what friends we had / until we came to leningrad
sean spicers stutters &amp stammers every time he lies &amp tries to defend the indefensible a great basis for the latest drinking game
trump said this guy should be thrown out of an airplane w/o a parachute for being a traitor but respects
trump tweet that putin smart didnt he talk to flynn about it that day
another takeaway trump values loyalty and trust over whether a key person has clearly broken the law and violated his oath
working hard to pin this on sally

did know about &amp may have put at risk
do u think u maintain any relevance aftr ur embarrassing ignorance yesterday abt
be serious about actions legal or not is matter of trust clear about outed by
said that learned that lied to them on jan 26 so why did it take until feb 13 for to lose trust
and she got fired cause trump is a prideful imbecile
seems to me the worst thing being said today isnt in fact the reality lots of political posturing going on around
spicer keeps saying flynns trust in the president was not holding up not the other way around
omg spicer the prez took immediate &amp decisive action to not fire right away
knew for weeks about amd
no one is buying this spicer is making a bad case for you
the guy who put on notice is no more in office
spicer just credited w taking decisive action  17 days after finding out was sharing info w 🇷🇺 
methinks thou dost protest a bit much
just in jason chaffetz rut has just been appointed head of the house oversight committee
let me get this straight rather than investigate the story worried more abt who leaked alternative reality
we heard about hillarys emails for months during election now theres no inves planned for  really
is a great guy flynn did a great job flynn is a great patriot flynn did no wrong so he is gone good god blood in the water
trump delayed action slow slug like so traitor sat in on weeks of high security meetings

well doh it is not a major shakeup to have someone put under so much disgusting pressure to have to resign
hi igor here guess what spooks sayin they are recording this no way this is a pay as you go phone they never have loose change
are they forgetting the part when told them was compromised
  summary of phone calls with the russia ambassador (number of calls substance) with vp mike pence
media journalists determined to mold situation to fit their desired narrative its not going to happen
so is now blaming non disclosure on  unfuckingbelievable bigly
is a casualty of our previous loving cia chief time to
so the wh says trump didnt ask to discuss sanctions with we are supposed to believe a pathological liar because
traitor michael flynn resigns caught lying about russia
if can be counselled then why not if he didnt really do anything wrong liar impeach tinyhands
just catching up on the scandal a look back at what led to the national security advisors resignation
really the question is where was the doj also leaks are bad
sean spicer is now blaming the dept of justice
the decisive action your boss took was to fire the &amp not dump
now sean spicer deflecting blame to doj for  the more the wh tries to act like nothing is amiss the more guilty it appears to be
this is not about trustleaks or anything whatsoever except outted (remember…
or why had full confidence in as of yesterday
hey why is the using the term resignation when clearly was fired
what did we do with our evenings before white house press briefings were live tweeted
if real issue is leaks then u still would trust but for the beans being spilled
i think bipartisan call on russia is fair russian ambassador over stepped his authority and got g in trouble with help
blaming the doj why fire sally let me ask some questions
at least we know why sally yates was fired she was warned she was given an explanation
saying that due process prevented from firing on 1/27 umm  theres no due process for a wh job
can you imagine how deep this stuff is for anyone to quit on
sean im not going to get into the specifics spicer
lost faith in when he saw the doj announcement on fox news flynns a fall guy  will be taken care of
here it is the summation of the question the wh needs to answer
there is no need for an investigation to find more information until we have more information youre reprehensible
needs to tell the truth about having call about rescinding sanctions after the inaug if not him
the president was unbelievably decisive in not doing anything about for 18 days according to sad
well having open talks at a dinner table at his florida white house doesnt help to keep the leaks from happening

just in jason chaffetz rut has just been appointed head of the house overlook committee

realizing using words like immediately is not that good now we talk about leaks mention 45 praising dnc
so much fun watching lying through his teeth about and
wait he dismissed but didnt dismiss immediately
when leaks saved us from and spicer is furious about
omg trump said he got up this morning he is probably lying lmao
as my senators please demand an investigation into and the trump administrations involvement w/ russia
holy heck this explains why trumpers are so gullible &amp ignorant tho…
thanks for some levity in this situation its a trust issue not a legal issue
a liar fires another liar forlying it just keeps getting better
gareth porter trump will continue obamas yemen policy ie us aerial refuelling bombs &amp politicaldiplomatic…
lets see said 45 did not instruct 2 speak w/russ based on 45s penchant 4 we must insist on a indie investigation
goodness third time ive tweeted this today went because he could not get on with his admin colleagues end of story if he were
i remember obama telling russia he would have more flexibility after the election on live tv
didnt have a good handle on security matters anyway if he didnt even know his calls were recorded bad judgement both he &amp
what does the fiasco say about trumps judgement what did trump know &amp when matt lauer russian cruise…
to some degree its your responsibility to report that re journos and leaks re does he think journos jobs are
if 45 was investigating 4 weeks why did he only do something abt it after the story broke sorry didnt come from wh
if did no wrong according to legal review and why did flynn lie about it then your story
  so starting with basics he made a mistake as he did as noted previously re prior turkey related lobbying
sacked over trust issue white house says
the silence from the gop is stunning
traitor michael flynn resigns caught lying about russia
questioning judgment why appoint in the first place investigates
lets not for get trump knows putin watch the video and share he needs to be accountable
is illiterate he keeps saying lost his trust flynn didnt lose trust did is he talking like that on purpose
if the fiascos an exmpl of extreme vetting by the how can we trust them w/ policy
no you dont get to tell us what the issues are this is entirely about what said and who knew about it
remember when trump &amp flynn chanted lock her up with their fellow deplorables oh the sweet irony
small town on the or coast &amp i just heard a lot of rumbling from jets overhead whats up with that do i feel safe…
is there any chance trump has an enforceable nda from flynn hes not one to take to being under a bus well

no sean spicer whistleblowers do not put the nation in danger those who try to shush up whistleblowers put the nation in danger
the flynn situation makes emails look like emails
is spicey seriously trying to say that the bigger story is the leaks and not what was in the leaks keep spinning…
why is this up to to decide whether to investigate and  cmon senate and congress do your damn job traitors
spicer confirms trump knew for weeks that misled the american people &amp was vulnerable to russian blackmailand trump did nothing
listening to is making my head spin just admit you guys messed up should testify against you and the rest
wh says trump did not ask to discuss sanctions with russia and we are supposed to believe a pathological liar because
believe it or not they are actually getting dumber
says knew weeks ago about &amp well duh trump is the chief conspirator
spicer says the problem is leaks what do you think flynn was doing
the real story is you knew for weeks of lies and you did nothing or as we say in the 
youre so funny was leaking to the russians thats the problem
dont let become a scapegoat this goes all the way to the top
and just what are the russians saying about the latest debacle
gutless and political apparently did not get permission fro pres bannon
departure is only the latest in a growing list of russia setbacks for trumps young presidency
ah yes history repeats itself
 its the &amp (r)s in congress who vetted traitor indicative of skills
defends fmr natsec adviser theres nothing that the general did that was a violation of any sort
the cowardly just tried to throw under the bus for selection of
 oh and if hes such a promise keeper does that mean he is going to release his tax returns
cover up additional leaks what did spicer say
you cant just accuse people of any wrong doing you have to do a investigation first
the admits that knew for weeks wasnt truthful about his calls | via
sorry  just seeing  when does the doll come out
flynns resignation is not the end of the storyit is only the beginning
g on his side confided with his enemy number one instead of confiding with very unfortunate situation
is basically saying trump wants to make sure his phone calls with putin are private and no one leaks them
we know wont get into details re liars never do
  so in a simplistic bestcase outlook one can say this can be contained wrt a trump admin point of view
sally yates did her job treason trump administration trump fired yates
took two weeks or more to take action on but he manages to make other major decisions over dinner
am i correct that grounds for already exist at 25 days into the presidency

sick house panel wont investigate over lies will probe instead
in an administration renown for lies and alternative facts the word trust has absolutely no place
we supporters have got to get loud and stop these attacks
spicy wth is an eroding issue your career and trumps admin yes
theyre ramping up the scapegoating now must spill the beans to have any shred of a reputation after this

 the puppeteers are a pulling the strings  no corp🇺🇸 politicians can do what is right for america…
how surreal it is to watch this video today
request full investigation of matter including if anyone else on trumps team knew of flynns talks w
the ghosts of twitter past haunts donald once again
yeah like no prob invite fully in on all security meetings for the past 3 weeks after yates warnings
honestly the media made claims about long before he was confirmed pres takes decisive action after learning of his calls
somebody remind that talking sanctions w/ russian ambassador before jan 20th undermined the sitting president
these are not but holes which of washington
this rwnj shows proof that russia didnt like him based on resignation letter why investigate any further…
just said we speak on behalf &amp at the direction of does that mean was acting at the direction of
nails on chalk board &gt attempt at lying
speaking on behalf of the president will have a karma effect
of course theyre all going to board the bus and run over repeatedly
press sec on at some point that trust eroded
in flames poodle runs away from probe anyone expect anything else ha ha ha
tries to sweep scandal under rug w/lies (no wonder he is getting along
one sliver of the basket has been peeled off keep up the good work dems and msm 
the story on what flynn did is unclear
as a lifelong republican this is not a partisan issue americans demand a full bipartisan investigation immediately
make america great again oh wait this is the opposite of great this isungreat
why was allowed to receive classified info even though there was suspicion re talks with russia
has a medal just like one of thesestill think he was a great choice
silence &amp inaction indicates approval time to sit outside their offices until they investigate wewillnot move…
playing chess knowing he just lost playing checkers
just said all the words of the administration are at the behest of so that would include would it
/ making the patsy like lee harvey oswald claimed he was all bad acts have *fall guy* we need snakes head
guess what now what your comments re are ridiculously partisan the 27th elects a better representative
the funny part is that you actually believe this whole russia shit will disappear by sacrificing
thinking of picking up the but i already watch the news
does russia have dirt on the like dirt on after all i ts a matter of trust
the ghost of twitter past haunts donald once again
how can mislead but not mislead does the national security advisor report to or
no discussion about funny that 
when it comes to the parody known as who knows what can be trusted fool
all of the words of this administration speaks for the president  did also speak 4 him did &amp broke law
i was thinking about this last night 😐
scapegoat who else is all in on russia collusion flynn time to testify under oath
good question by about whether or not there is concern within wh about any misleading info from on other issues
trumps insistence on keeping his plans secret is exactly why there are leaks we demand transparency from the white house
the leakers who exposed gen s committed serious  and wholly justified  felonies by
so michael flynn exposed by a leaker could be replaced by david petraeus who knows all about leaking classified intel
ignored justice department warning that could be vulnerable to blackmail
  and it does not take much imagination to see brennan fingerprints on this anyway sally yates has gone
is in violation of logan act potus direct collusion with russia investigate
with all has done how is it not enough to impeach him im confused i think americans deserve more respect
question how do you forget committing treason
exactly at what point weeks after being informed that flynn lied about sanction talks w/ russia did pres trumps trust in erode
possibly from camp itself to justify what they wanted to do anyway went off rails years ago &amp everyone knew it
oh so if everything is at the direction of trump then that means acted on behalf of trump 😒 thanks for clearing that up spicer
says didnt break any rules what about the logan act
thank goodness for the follow up
mistrust erosion is the name of my new rolling stones cover band
keep spinning i personally wouldnt be saying we all speak for the president but whatever
weeks hes only had the job for a little over 3 weeks its unacceptable
why not because he doesnt think was did wrong just something inadvertent in a chat with the vp about…
hes not unsuspecting &amp hes unfit to lead and hes a dick not a boob boobs are useful
roses are red violets are blue if had ties to russia does too
white house should start listening to what they call fake news as networks like have been reporting on issues with for weeks
great article on and and other choice of
at some random point that trust between and eroded i bet it was a monday afternoon theyre tough
he might as well said get blasts leaks as senators talk after resignation
doctor what have we got a republic or a monarchy with no hesitation whatsoever franklin responded a republi…
i thought you might find this view from a different perspective interesting
well thank you for clarifying that all of you speak for the so surely that included right
blame the jews for michael flynns resignation
hey jim is still subject to the lobbying ban put in place for his admin
asks to resign over eroding trust y we or sc ask ns to resign over on eroding nations trust
your russian buddies just deployed a cruise missile in violation of cold war treaty whatcha gonna do
well i think youd have to say that on balance the first few weeks of trumps presidency are going just swimmingly eh
this story goes deep into colluded with to rig election and gop knows it

to last nightshouldve just tweeted this out and saved some embarrassment
a valentine by easy d
did anyone catch sean spicers freudian slip when he said that trump aides russia
  but she is not the only holdover more seriously obama/estab sleeper and more seriously it is
